      <description>I love R and statistics and an always looking for new ways to contribute to understanding opportunities and making good decisions. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good characterization of my career managing investment portfolios. My newly honed data science skills can be applied there or in many other interesting fields. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to apply them in the next chapter of my working life. I have lots of other interests as well. My undergraduate training was in music and that remains central in my life, especially vocal music of all kinds.</description>
