I love R and statistics and an always looking for new ways to contribute to understanding opportunities and making good decisions.  That's a pretty good characterization of my career managing investment portfolios. My newly honed data science skills can be applied there or in many other interesting fields.  I'm excited to apply them in the next chapter of my working life.
I have lots of other interests as well. My undergraduate training was in music and that remains central in my life, especially vocal music of all kinds. I also love photography and sailing!
